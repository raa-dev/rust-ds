# Data Structures Crate
This is a library of data structures implemented in Rust. The goal of this project is to provide a collection of data structures that are not available in the Rust standard library. The library is designed to be easy to use and efficient.

This crate still in early stage of development, but the intended objective is to provide the following data structures:
* [Linked List](src/linked_list/README.md)
* [Double Linked List](src/double_linked_list/README.md)
* Stack
* Queue
* Tree
* Graph
* Heap
