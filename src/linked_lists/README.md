# Linked List
A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object. Each element (we will call it a node) of a list is consisting of two items - the data and a reference to other nodes. The last node has a reference to `None`. The entry point into a linked list is called the head of the list. It should be noted that the head is not a separate node, but the reference to the first node. If the list is empty then the head is a `None` reference.

## Operations
The following operations are defined for a linked list:
- **Insertion**: Adds an element at the end of the list.
- **Pop**: Removes the last element from the list.
- **Remove**: Removes an element from the list.
- **Search**: Searches for an element in the list.
- **Update**: Updates an element in the list.
- **Get**: Returns the element at a given index.
